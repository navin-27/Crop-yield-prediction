# Crop-yield-prediction
# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction Project

This project focuses on analyzing agricultural data from an Excel dataset (`crop_csv_file.xlsx`) to predict crop yield based on various input features. It uses Python's data science stack including **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File**: `crop_csv_file.xlsx`
- **Contents**: Crop-related features such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and crop yield.
- **Format**: Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess agricultural data.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on crop yield features.
- Train machine learning models to predict crop yield.
- Visualize model performance and insights from the data.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
   
2. Open your downloaded Jupyter notebook file: jupyter notebook cyp.ipynb

3. Make sure the file crop_csv_file.xlsx is placed in the same directory or edit the path.

## 🧠 Models Used:
Linear Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Random Forest Regressor


## 📊 Results:
Accuracy Scores for each model

Visualizations of predicted vs actual crop yields

Feature importance charts

## 📌 Future Enhancements:
Using deep learning models for better prediction.

Integrate real-time weather APIs.

Building a simple dashboard using Flask/Streamlit.
